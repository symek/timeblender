==Desired smoothness==
This was my intuition from the beginning, which I assumed correct for choosing interpolation function. It seems to be fine, though I wouldn't be able to prove it ;)
 
Our interpolation function should have constant 2nd derivatives, because sampling theorem guarantees us, that any motion recored (sampled) by evenly spaced camera shutter will have no details happening beyond Nyquist limit. In other words, objects animated inside Houdini, and recorded once per frame in ifd/bgeo, *must* move with constant acceleration from frame to frame. In opposite case, there would be details of underlaying function not captured by our samples, what seems to violate our premise of bandwidth limited function.
