VRAY_TimeBlender v.0.1.1, 05.02.2012, 

DESCRIPTION

TimeBlender is Mantra's VRAY_Procedural object which computes a series of interpolated geometry
from time samples at rendertime. It acts as a replacement for Mantra Delay Load Archive,
which allows you to attach more than a single blur file to your archive. 

You can use both super-sampled geometries and integer frame geometries, with or without
interpolation applied. Additionally, you can render particles  with variable point count,
prividing geometry with 'id' point attribute present. 
        
Besides Houdini native splines, TimeBlender uses barycentric rational interpolator:
"Barycentric Rational Interpolation with no Poles and High Rates of Approximation"
by Michael S. Floater and Kai Hormann. Implementation is based on "Numerical Recipes".


INSTALL

To install, as usual, source Houdini's environment:

> cd houdini/path
> source houdini_setup_bash

then cd to timeblender directory and:

> make

a) Copy VRAY_TimeBlender.so/dll to one of $HOUDINI_PATH/dso location (like $HOME/houdinix.x/dso/mantra).
b) Copy otls/TimeBlender_vX.x.x.otl to your location (like $HOME/houdinix.x/otls)
c) Copy (if it doesn't exist there) VRAYprocedural from $HFS/houdini to $HOME/houdinix.x
d) Add bellow line to the file (read comments inside it): 
   timeblender DSO_FILE(VRAY_TimeBlender);
   
   
USAGE:
   Most parameters has pop-ups with Help.
   TBD.


ISSUES:
1) Enlarge bounds with all geometry involved.
2) Assing material.
3) Shutter nonlinear retime.
4) Delete missing points.
5) Interpolate attributes (currently only P is used).
6) Threading. 
7) Recreate workflow for SOPs (replace TimeblendSOP).
8) Bugs?
